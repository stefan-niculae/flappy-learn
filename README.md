## Description

There is only one button: jump. The objective is to survive as long as possible without hitting the spikes or falling off-screen. The gap between spikes gets increasingly smaller, until a bird can no longer pass through it (at around score 80).

## Demo

Start a run by accessing [stefann.eu/flappy-learn](http://stefann.eu/flappy-learn) and watch your birds learn how to fly. If you wish to observe a high-scoring bird, load the brain from `demo/champion.json`.

## How?

Each bird's brain is a neural network with a few hidden layers and one output. It takes as input the x and y distances from the next gap center and the output dictates whether it should jump. This brain is simulated multiple times per second.

To optimize the network, a genetic algorithm is used. The fitness function is the bird's age â€“ the time it survived.

The initial population consists of many birds with random weights. Each subsequent generation is built upon the previous like so:

- the fittest genomes are selected
- the best one, together with some lucky ones are mutated by applying random variation to their weights
- offsprings are created by picking two winning genomes and randomly swapping their weights
